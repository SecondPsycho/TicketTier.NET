# TicketTier.NET
A simple Bug Tracker I developed to help me practice MVC and SQL.

## Functionality
It's not much, but it allows users to:
- Create a custom "Ticket" with custom Name and Description.
- View Tickets.
- Edit Tickets.
- Delete Tickets.

It also:
- Saves data to a database, so it can be accessed across sessions.
- Sanitizes user input.

## Tech Stack
It uses:
- .NET
- Model/View/Controller (MVC) framework
- C#
- SQLite
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

And it was coded on a Windows 10 operating system using Visual Studio Code.

## To-Do
If I ever find the time to keep working on this, my top priorities would be:
- Add User Authentication and Session Data
- Implement Bootstrap.js
- Allow Users to reorder Tickets and place them in larger categories, called "Tiers."
